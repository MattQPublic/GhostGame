# GhostGame

This is a tic-tac-toe game that has been themed for the Swedish metal band "Ghost".
I made it as a class project for "The Complete Android N Developer Course", which
I highly recommend, and can be found here:

Some of the game logic was written by the course instructor Rob Percival.  
The rest was written by Matt Siegel.
Some of the media (sound and images) are copyrighted, and should be covered by "fair use" because this was a class project.
If you are the copyright holder of any of the media in this game, and want it removed, send me a message, and I'll remove it.

If you want to rebrand this game with some other identity, simply fork the project, replace all the media within, and change the filename arrays.

Under no circumstances can this app be sold for money (see copyright notice above).
Educational purposes only!

Have fun.  Love Ghost.  Buy their albums!
